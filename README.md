Portion of the code shared with Freelancer.

These are the 3 classes that do most of the work and need to be optimized. One of the classes is multi-processed so fairly opitimzed.

Analyzer.py is the main class which kicks things off.

Analyzer_Thread.py needs to be the most optimized. This is where most of the processing occurs.

Strategy_MACD_2 could likely be a little more optimized, but probably not the priority.
